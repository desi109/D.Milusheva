<p>As you start learning Java or some other object-oriented programming language, you are going to get familiar with Data Structures and Algorithms. And maybe you will have some questions: </p>

<li>What are Data Structures and Algorithms? </li>
<li>What good will it do me to know about them? </li>
<li>Why can’t I just use arrays and for loops to handle my data? </li>
<li>When does it make sense to apply what I learn here? </li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This blog post attempts to answer these questions. For those of you who haven’t yet been exposed to an object-oriented language or Java, you can read my previous <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="post (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dev-guide.org/getting-started-with-java/" target="_blank">post</a>.  Now let's get started and learn something more about  Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>

<h3>  What Are Data Structures and Algorithms?  </h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A <strong>data structure</strong> is an arrangement of data in a computer’s memory (or sometimes on a disk). Data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, binary trees, and hash tables, among others. </p>
<p><strong>Algorithms</strong> manipulate the data in these structures in various ways, such as searching for a particular data item, sorting the data, insert a new data item or delete a specified item. </p>
<p>Maybe you are wondering what sorts of problems can you solve with a knowledge of these topics? Let's say that there are three useful categories: </p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>How to Handle Real-World Data Storage?</strong> <br />By real-world data, I mean data that describes physical entities external to the computer. As an example, one phone book describes real phone contacts with people. It will have the following information for each entry - first name, last name, phone number, address. You might find yourself with questions like these: </p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> How would you store the data in your computer’s memory? <br /> <strong>-</strong> Would your method work for a hundred records? A thousand? A million? <br /> <strong>-</strong> Would your method permit quick insertion of a new record and deletion of old ones?<br /> <strong>-</strong> Would it allow for fast searching for a specified record? <br /> <strong>-</strong> How would you sort the records in alphabetic order? </p>
<p>As you learn about Data Structures and Algorithms, you will begin to find answers to these questions and problems.</p>
</li>
<li> <strong>Data Structures for Programmers</strong> <br />Not all data storage structures are used to store real-world data. Typically, real-world data is accessed more or less directly by a program’s user. Some data storage structures, however, are not meant to be accessed by the user, but by the program itself. A programmer uses such structures as tools to facilitate some other operation. For example, stacks, queues, and priority queues are often used in this way.
</li>
<li><strong>World Modeling</strong> <br />Some data structures directly model real-world situations. The most important data structure of this type is the graph. You can use graphs to represent airline routes between cities or connections in an electric circuit or tasks in a project. Another example is the queue, which can model customers waiting in line at a bank. </li>
