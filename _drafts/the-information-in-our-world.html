<p>As you all know these days, information is everywhere. Tons of information flows are moving around us. So today we will track -<em> how we have learned to process and use all of this information</em>. But first, what does the word <strong><em>INFORMATION</em></strong> mean? The term <em>information</em> comes from the Latin word "informatio" which means information. In general, it can be said that information is knowledge, information from the world around us, which is used to interact with it.<br />Ever since ancient times, people have sought opportunities to retrieve, transmit, present and use information. People communicated with each other through speech and thus exchanged knowledge and ideas. But at some point, this information had to be stored so that it could be disseminated even more easily. The ancient people painted on the walls of the caves they inhabited. Thus, they passed on basic knowledge, such as hunting, to future generations. A little later, the writing appeared, as well as various accounting systems (for processing numerical information). People begin to record their knowledge of books. Sciences such as mathematics, physics, philosophy, etc. are being developed. Printing machines appear. And at the end of the 20th century, the computer was invented. People's various attempts to automate the processing of information over the centuries can be summarized in three main stages.</p>

<p>The first attempts to record information were ancient drawings on stone, wood, and earthenware. Hieroglyphs appear in ancient Egypt  About 3000 BC. And in the coming centuries, many other scriptures of different nations appeared. People begin to write their knowledge first on papyrus, and later on paper and books. In the beginning, everything is handwritten until the printing machine is invented and the whole process is automated. People are given much greater access to information and new knowledge, which gives a great impetus to human development.</p>

<p>We can say that the person has been trying to automate the processing of information since ancient times. An example of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus">abacus</a>. <br />In 1602 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale">logarithmic scale</a> was invented. And this was just the beginning of a new era. Between 1642 and 1673 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> creates a machine for addition and subtraction, and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> refines it by adding multiplication.</p>

<p>In 1820 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Xavier_Thomas">Charles Thomas de Colmar</a> invented the first commercially successful&nbsp;mechanical calculator, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmometer">Arithmometer</a>.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>&nbsp;was an English&nbsp;polymath and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a digital programmable computer. In 1833 he proposed the design of a machine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical Engine</a>) representing a true computer model with a central processor and a patch.<br />He was considered by some to be a "<em>father of the computer</em>".<br />In 1890 the American businessman and inventor  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Hollerith">Herman Hollerith</a> developed the electromechanical&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabulating_machine">tabulating machine</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">punched cards</a>&nbsp;to assist in summarizing information and, later, in accounting. His invention of the punched card tabulating machine, patented in 1884, marks the beginning of the era of semiautomatic&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing">data processing</a>&nbsp;systems.  In 1896 Hollerith founded The Tabulating Machine Company.  In 1911 four corporations, including Hollerith's firm, were amalgamated to form the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing-Tabulating-Recording_Company">Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company</a>&nbsp;(CTR).&nbsp;Under the presidency of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson">Thomas J. Watson</a>, CTR was renamed&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Business_Machines">International Business Machines Corporation</a>&nbsp;(IBM) in 1924. By 1933 The Tabulating Machine Company name had disappeared as subsidiary companies were subsumed by IBM. </p>

<p>Entering the new century, technology development was gaining more and more speed.<br />One of the major contributors to the development of computer science was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Mathison Turing</a>. He was highly influential in the development of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science">theoretical computer science</a>, providing a formalization of the concepts of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation">computation</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>, which can be considered a model of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computer">general-purpose computer</a>.&nbsp;Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and&nbsp;artificial intelligence.  During the&nbsp;Second World War, Turing worked for the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters#Government_Code_and_Cypher_School_(GC&amp;CS)">Government Code and Cypher School</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bletchley Park, Britain's&nbsp;codebreaking&nbsp;center that produced&nbsp;Ultra&nbsp;intelligence. For a time he led&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_8">Hut 8</a>, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">ciphers</a>, including improvements to the pre-war Polish&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomba_(cryptography)">bombe</a>&nbsp;method, an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromechanics">electromechanical</a>&nbsp;machine that could find settings for the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma machine</a>. <br />There is no way I missed mentioning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov_Jr.">Andrey Markov Jr.</a><strong> </strong>who was a&nbsp;Soviet mathematician and one of the key founders of the Russian school of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_mathematics">constructive mathematics</a>&nbsp;and logic. He made outstanding contributions to various areas of mathematics, including&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation">differential equations</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic">mathematical logic</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics">foundations of mathematics</a>. His name is in particular associated with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_principle">Markov's principle</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_principle#Markov's_rule">Markov's rule</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_algorithm">Markov algorithm</a>. </p>

<p>Many machines and devices have been developed in the coming years to make data analysis faster and easier. <br />The  German&nbsp;engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a> invented the world's first programmable computer <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)">Z3</a></strong> in May 1941. It was the world's first working&nbsp;programmable, fully automatic&nbsp;digital computer. The Z3 was built with 2,600&nbsp;relays, implementing a 22-bit word&nbsp;length that operated at a&nbsp;clock frequency&nbsp;of about 4–5&nbsp;Hz. The program code was stored on punched&nbsp;film. Initial values were entered manually. &nbsp;<br />In the years 1943–1945 British&nbsp;codebreakers created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer">Colossus</a>. It&nbsp;was a set of&nbsp;computers&nbsp;developed to help in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Lorenz_cipher">cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher</a>. Colossus is thus regarded&nbsp;as the world's first&nbsp;programmable, electronic,&nbsp;digital&nbsp;computer.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken">Howard Hathaway Aiken</a>&nbsp;was an American&nbsp;physicist&nbsp;and a&nbsp;pioneer&nbsp;in&nbsp;computing. Inspired by&nbsp;Charles Babbage's&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">difference engine</a>, he envisioned an electro-mechanical computing device that could do much of the tedious work for him. This computer was originally called the ASCC (Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator) and later renamed&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I">Harvard Mark I</a>. With engineering, construction, and funding from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a>, the machine was completed and installed at Harvard in February 1944. Three years later, Aiken completed his work on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_II">Harvard Mark II</a>&nbsp;computer. He continued his work on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_III">Mark III</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_IV">Harvard Mark IV</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vincent_Atanasoff">John  Atanasoff</a> was best known for being credited with inventing the first electronic digital computer in the 1930s. Challenges to his claim were resolved in 1973 when the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell_v._Sperry_Rand">Honeywell v. Sperry Rand</a></em> lawsuit ruled that Atanasoff was the inventor of the computer. His special-purpose machine has come to be called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atanasoff%E2%80%93Berry_Computer">Atanasoff–Berry Computer</a>.<br /> Between 1944 and 1946 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mauchly">John Mauchly</a> along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Presper_Eckert">John Eckert</a>, designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a> (<em>Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer</em>), the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, by using the idea of Atanasoff.  It was able to solve "a large class of numerical problems" through reprogramming. The two professors design four machines together and the successor to ENIAC is  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDVAC">EDVAC</a>  (<em>Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer</em>). In 1949 they created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BINAC">BINAC</a> (<em>Binary Automatic Computer</em>). It was an early electronic computer designed for Northrop Aircraft Company.  And in 1951 was created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I">UNIVAC I</a> (<em>UNIVersal Automatic Computer I</em>). It was an electronic digital computer design for business applications. <br />On April 29, 1952, IBM started selling the first commercial scientific computer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_701">IBM 701</a> (<em>Electronic Data Processing Machine</em>) and in 1965 was created the model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360">System/360</a>. From August 1980 IBM started a significant production of personal computers.</p>

<p>In 1976  the Apple Computer Company released a desktop computer  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">Apple-1</a>. It was designed and hand-built by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>. The idea of selling the computer came from Wozniak's friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>. The Apple-1 was Apple's first product. <br />On November 20, 1985, Microsoft introduced an operating environment named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a> as a graphical operating system shell for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer market with over 90% market share, overtaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS">Mac OS</a>, which had been introduced in 1984. </p>
