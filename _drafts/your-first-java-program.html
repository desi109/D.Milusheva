<p>The Java language is easier to understand (and write) than languages such as C and C++. The biggest reason for this is that Java doesn‚Äôt use pointers. Some people are surprised that pointers aren‚Äôt necessary for the creation of complex data structures and algorithms. In fact, eliminating pointers makes such code not only easier to write and to understand but more secure and less prone to errors as well. Java is a modern object-oriented language, which means we can use an object-oriented approach for programming examples. This is important, because object-oriented programming (OOP) offers compelling advantages over the old-fashioned procedural approach, and is quickly supplanting it for serious program development. </p>

<h4>What is OOP and which are its basic concepts?</h4>

<p>When we say that Java is an object-oriented programming language we mean that Java is a language in which programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an instance of a class. There are four principle concepts upon which object-oriented design and programming rest. They are:</p>
<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> - refers to the act of representing essential features without including background details or explanations. It shows only the necessary details for an object, not its inner details. <strong><em>Example:</em></strong> A car in itself is a well-defined object, which is composed of several other smaller objects like a gearing system, steering mechanism, engine, which again have their own subsystems. But for humans car is one single object, which can be managed by the help of its subsystems, even if their inner details are unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphism</strong> - can be briefly described as "one interface, many implementations". But if you do not know what is an interface, let's say that polymorphism is a characteristic of being able to assign different meaning or usage to something in different contexts - specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form. <br /><strong><em>Example: </em></strong>If we have class Animals. For this example,  animals can be cats or dogs. Animals make sounds but the sound of the cat is "meow" and the sound of the dog is "bark". The two sounds are different but they are still sound and they are made from the animals - cat and dog. </p>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> - it is a concept where one class shares the structure, properties of object and behavior defined in another class. A class that is inherited is called a <strong>superclass</strong> and the class that does the inheriting is called a <strong>subclass</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> - is a technique used for hiding the properties and behavior of an object and allowing outside access only as appropriate. It prevents other objects from directly altering or accessing the properties or methods of the encapsulated objects. Levels of encapsulation are <em>public</em>, <em>protected</em> and <em>private</em> (they are called <strong>access modifiers</strong>). We will discuss them later.</p>

<h4>What is Class?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A class is a template from which individual objects are created in the memory. A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object. At its core, a class definition is a block of code, delimited by braces ‚Äú{‚Äù and ‚Äú}‚Äù, within which is included declarations of instance variables and methods that are the members of the class. In this section, we will undertake a deeper examination of class definitions in Java.</p>

<h4>What is Object?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An object is termed as an instance of a class, and it has its own state, behavior, and identity.</p>

<p>Now, let's make a simple overview of the Java programming language and begin our Java primer with a program that prints ‚ÄúHello Universe!‚Äù on the screen.</p>

<p>In Java, executable statements are placed in functions, known as <strong>methods</strong>, that belong to <strong>class</strong> definitions. The Universe class, in our first example, is extremely simple - it has only one method, which is executed when we run the Java program. Any set of statements between the braces ‚Äú{‚Äù and ‚Äú}‚Äù define a <strong>program block</strong>. <br />The name of a class, method, or variable in Java is called an <strong>identifier</strong>, which can be any string of characters as long as it begins with a letter and consists of letters, numbers, and underscore characters.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We already said that the key-word <strong>public</strong> is an access modifier and it tells that access is possible from everywhere. For example, our class can be accessed from other classes and e.g.  Between the braces of the class, we have one method. Its name is <strong>main()</strong>.  A Java program begins execution with its main() method and it is the gateway to the startup of a Java process. It keeps our code long enough available to do the work we‚Äôve coded.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs now review the words in the main() method‚Äôs signature, one at a time. The keyword <strong>static </strong>means that the method can be invoked without instantiating an object. Java doesn‚Äôt need to create an object to call the main() method‚Äîwhich is good since you haven‚Äôt learned about creating objects yet! The keyword <strong>void</strong> represents the return type. A method that returns no data returns control to the caller silently. Finally, we arrive at the main() method‚Äôs parameter list, represented as an array of objects. In practice, you can write <strong>String[] args</strong>. The variable name <em>args</em> hints that this list contains values that were read in (arguments) when the program is started. In the body of the method between the second brackets, we are using a command that prints text on the console (in our case the text is "Hello Universe!").</p>

<p>So, this was a really simple program with some explanations for beginners. Well done! Just keep studying. üòâ</p>
